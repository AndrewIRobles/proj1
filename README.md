# Pups-Parks-n-Playdates

A puppy playdate mobile app that utilizes Firebase, Moment, and API calls to Google Maps, Google Places, and OpenWeatherMaps.


## Description

   This mobile-first app allows users to plan outings with their dog to nearby parks.
   After entering their zipcode, the user will see brief weather info a list of local parks and their locations(rendered as buttons).  Once a park button is clicked, the app will render a map with a marker on the park, as well as a list of other users already at that park.
   Each user's input will include their dog's name, age, breed, and the times at which they will be at the park.  This allows users to better plan their pup's outing, as they will be able to see what breeds of dogs will be present for their dog to interact with. This can also be used to avoid populated parks if their pup doesn't play well with others.
   The user can then click a button to confirm that they plan to go to the selected park. This will bring up a form to input their own dog's information and time they plan to be there.  Other users can then see their info populated in that park.
